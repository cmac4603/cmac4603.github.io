                    Began writing `python` code on the Raspberry Pi, and that was a lot of fun. At the time I was working
                    offshore on survey vessels, but I soon realized I had a passion for this stuff.

                    Began working at Hearst UK in 2016 and intitially this was meant as a one or probably two year
                    stepping stone to becoming a "proper" software developer; however, as I learnt and worked on more projects,
                    I realized that the job I had was exactly what I was looking for: writing code. I've since stayed
                    and worked on and managed some awesome projects; from architecting a whole internal loadtesting platform,
                    writing CI/CD CLI tooling, to edge computing. My go to language these days is `rust`, because rust is cool :shades:

                    Started talking with a friend & former colleague about making a SaaS for loadtesting after being unhappy with current offerings.
                    After about 18 months, this evolved into wanting to just make general tooling around app deployment and specifically
                    development. Fun fact: `Metricul` was originally called `pummel-io` when it was just about loadtesting.
