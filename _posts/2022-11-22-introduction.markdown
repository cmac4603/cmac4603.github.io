Hi and welcome!

I'm going to be writing some things.

Mostly interested in tooling, performance insights, and infrastructure. App (container) building, loadtests, ... from local development to CI/CD deployment pipelines.

Some of it might be interesting, some of it might not be, we'll see.

This is meant as a diary of sorts, and so I don't forget what I did the week before.
