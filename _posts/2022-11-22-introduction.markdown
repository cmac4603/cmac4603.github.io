Hi and welcome!

I'm going to be writing some things around building developer & app tooling.

The plan is to successfully startup `Metricul`, a one-stop tooling and performance tuning shop for developers to use. Loadtests, flamegraphs, app (container) building, from local development to CI/CD deployment pipelines. `Metricul` is trying to minimize the amount of boilerplate it takes to build and deploy, but also make it easy to investigate and triage performance issues.

Some of it might be interesting, some of it might not be, we'll see.

This may never work out as originally intended, or probably there will be a pivot or two.

This is meant as a diary of sorts, and so I don't forget what I did the week before.
